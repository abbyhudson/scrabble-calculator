# scrabble-calculator

Very simple calculator that determines how much a word in Scrabble would be worth. Used in a presentation to simply explain how to tackle common issues in code for those who might be beginners to being teaching assistants as well as programming in general. You can view the presentation inside of this repository. This was done for my CSC 295 - Special Topics in Computer Science: TA Training class.
